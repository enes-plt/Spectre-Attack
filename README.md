# Spectre-Attack
This project includes:

1.  Cache Timing: Differentiate between cache and memory access times.
2.  Side-Channel Attack: Use cache timing to retrieve secrets with the FLUSH+RELOAD technique.
3.  Speculative Execution: Observe out-of-order execution in CPUs.
4.  Spectre Attack: Implement Spectre to steal protected secrets within the same process.
5.  Enhancing Accuracy: Improve attack reliability with multiple iterations and scoring.
6.  Complete Secret Extraction: Extend the attack to steal a full secret string.

Each task reinforces concepts in speculative execution vulnerabilities and side-channel analysis, providing insights into modern CPU security flaws.
