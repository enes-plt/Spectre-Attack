# Spectre-Attack
This project includes sequential tasks starting from basic cache manipulation to advanced speculative execution techniques.
Code samples are provided to help set up side-channel attacks, and subjects are encouraged to experiment with and adapt the code to understand various aspects of the Spectre vulnerability fully.
Successful completion requires running, observing, and documenting experimental results and any notable behavior across different configurations.
